The Open-source Intelligence Data Mining System (OSINT), as is depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:CTraceOSINTSoftware}, is a newly developed sophisticated tool for a law enforcement agency, like the police department, to track theft and trafficking with the help of a precise analysis of call data records (CDRs) and tower dump data.Alongside the police, the one thing that this program needs is to gain huge data sets of the phone stuff and these huge sets that are cumulated are then finally processed and the results retrieved.

This is an application of the method to provide law enforcement agencies with a fast and quick way to analyze call data records (CDRs) and tower dump data.
C-Trace OSINT software is a value-add for investigators as they receive a good number of options for decision making, which in turn is a major progression in their case investigation.


\section{What is the purpose of C Trace's OSINT Software ?}\label{sec:what-is-the-purpose-of-c-trace's-osint-software-?}

C Trace's OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) software is designed to meet the specific needs of law enforcement agencies, particularly the police. The primary purpose of this software is to gather comprehensive information about suspects, which is crucial for police investigations.

Police officers often face restrictions when attempting to obtain data directly from companies. For example, while telecom operators may provide the name of the person who purchased a SIM card, they may not be able to provide information about the actual user of the SIM. This limitation can hinder investigations.

C Trace's OSINT software overcomes these restrictions by providing detailed information without such limitations. It offers:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Identification of Actual SIM Users:} The software can reveal the names of the actual users of SIM cards, not just the buyers.
    \item \textbf{Social Media Accounts and Bank Information:} It can provide access to suspects' social media accounts and bank details.
    \item \textbf{Leaked Information on the Internet:} The software also scours the internet for any leaked information related to the suspects.
\end{itemize}

\section{Problems solved with OSINT Software ?}\label{sec:problems-solved-with-osint-software-?}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Access Restrictions:} Police face restrictions in obtaining information directly from companies. This software provides the necessary data without such restrictions.
    \item \textbf{Identification of SIM Users:} Telecom operators often provide information about the buyer of a SIM card, but not the actual user. This software identifies the actual SIM users.
    \item \textbf{Comprehensive Data Collection:} It provides access to a wide range of information, including social media accounts and bank details, which are not easily obtainable through conventional means.
    \item \textbf{Leaked Information:} The software can find and utilize leaked information available on the internet, which can be crucial for investigations.
\end{itemize}

\section{What is OSINT Data Mining System ?}\label{sec:what-is-osint-data-mining-system-?}

The application developed is particularly made solely for police as a way to deal with crime by analyzing the call data record (CDR) information and tower dump data only.This tool provides a complex report on people using their phone number, IMEI number, PAN number, and such.It gains tower data, which can show all phone users that are living in a particular tower, by using azimuth ID. The report includes various pieces of information like a person's vehicle particulars, location data, IMEI numbers, phone numbers, PAN numbers, MNP, IP information, etc.And, the software also introduces a PDF that supplies all the necessary data about a person.
