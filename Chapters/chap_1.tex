The Open-source Intelligence Data Mining System (OSINT), as is depicted in Figure 1.1, is a newly developed sophisticated tool for a law enforcement agency, like the police department, to track theft and trafficking with the help of a precise analysis of call data records (CDRs) and tower dump data.Alongside the police, the one thing that this program needs is to gain huge data sets of the phone stuff and these huge sets that are cumulated are then finally processed and the results retrieved.

This is an application of the method to provide law enforcement agencies with a fast and quick way to analyze call data records (CDRs) and tower dump data.
C-Trace OSINT software is a value-add for investigators as they receive a good number of options for decision making, which in turn is a major progression in their case investigation.

\section{What is OSINT Data Mining System ?}\label{sec:what-is-osint-data-mining-system-?}

The application developed is particularly made solely for police as a way to deal with crime by analyzing the call data record (CDR) information and tower dump data only.This tool provides a complex report on people using their phone number, IMEI number, PAN number, and such.It gains tower data, which can show all phone users that are living in a particular tower, by using azimuth ID. The report includes various pieces of information like a person's vehicle particulars, location data, IMEI numbers, phone numbers, PAN numbers, MNP, IP information, etc.And, the software also introduces a PDF that supplies all the necessary data about a person.
