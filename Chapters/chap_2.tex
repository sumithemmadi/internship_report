JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are a popular method for managing sessions and authentication in web and mobile applications, including Android apps. In our Android app development, we leveraged JWT for secure and efficient session management. This section outlines how JWT tokens were utilized to manage user sessions in our Android app.

\subsection{JWT Token Generation}

When a user successfully logs in or authenticates in our Android app, a JWT token is generated by the backend server. This JWT token contains encoded user information, such as user ID, roles, and expiration time. The JWT token is then securely stored on the client-side, typically in the app's local storage or shared preferences.

\subsection{Token-Based Authentication}

For subsequent API requests or operations requiring authentication, the JWT token is sent along with the request headers. The backend server verifies the JWT token's authenticity and validity before processing the request. This token-based authentication mechanism eliminates the need for storing session information on the server-side, reducing server load and improving scalability.

\subsection{Token Expiration and Refresh}

JWT tokens have an expiration time set during token generation. When a JWT token expires, the client app can request a new token using a refresh token mechanism. The refresh token is a separate token with a longer expiration time, used to obtain a new JWT token without requiring the user to log in again. This ensures seamless and continuous session management in the app.
