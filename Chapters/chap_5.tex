        \item Express.js: Integrated with various technologies.
        \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
            \item \textbf{Court Checker:} Third-party tool with a large collection of Indian court cases, updated daily.
            \item \textbf{OSINT Search:} Gathers publicly available information to aid investigations.
            \item \textbf{Vehicle Information:} Retrieves details of vehicles using registration numbers.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Database:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Data collected from external APIs.
        \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
            \item \textbf{Court Checker:} Third-party tool with a large collection of Indian court cases, updated daily.
            \item \textbf{OSINT Search:} Gathers publicly available information to aid investigations.
            \item \textbf{Vehicle Information:} Retrieves details of vehicles using registration numbers.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item Data collected from scraping users' data from the internet.
        \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
            \item \textbf{Facebook:} Scraping Facebook profile names, photos, emails, and cities with Puppeteer using a username.
            \item \textbf{WhatsApp:} Collecting WhatsApp user images, names, about, and online status.
            \item \textbf{Leak OSINT:} Scraping users' leaked data from the internet.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item Data collected from Call One App.
        \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
            \item \textbf{Contacts:} The app collects users' contacts when the user first registers to the app and when a new contact is created.
            \item \textbf{Call Logs:} The app collects users' call logs every day and resolves the names of unknown calls.
            \item \textbf{Location Information:} User location is captured by the app as per the security requirements. The shared location is used for law enforcement purposes to track users' locations by the police department.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}

\subsection{Call One Old Architecture}\label{subsec:old-architecture}

The old architecture was built on React Native, but the app was very slow due to the bridge in React Native.
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    \item \textbf{Frontend:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item React Native: Intuitive UI for data collection and settings.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Backend:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Express.js: Integrated with various technologies.
        \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
            \item \textbf{Express.js:} Minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
            \item \textbf{PostgreSQL:} Stores user details like contacts, call logs, and device information.
            \item \textbf{Crypto-js:} Uses AES Encryption to encrypt user information transmitted over the server.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Call One New Architecture}\label{subsec:new-architecture}
In the new architecture, Kotlin was used along with additional services and optimizations.
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    \item \textbf{Frontend:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Kotlin: Used to develop the app with Jetpack Compose for UI.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Backend:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Same as old architecture.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{New Features in Call One}\label{subsec:new-features}
