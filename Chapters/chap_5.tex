The implementation phase of the project has followed a systematic approach, incorporating all the steps and methods mentioned in the previous chapters. This phase has utilized the mentioned tools and technologies to achieve the project's objectives effectively and efficiently. 

\section{OSINT Data Mining Software}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    \item \textbf{Frontend:} The frond end is design using .NET framework. The .NET Framework is a proprietary software framework developed by Microsoft that runs primarily on Microsoft Windows. It was the predominant implementation of the Common Language Infrastructure until being superseded by the cross-platform .NET project.
    
    \item \textbf{Bacnkend:} Backend server is design in Express.js. various technologies are integrated in the express.js app.
    
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
        \item \textbf{Court Checker} : The Verify 24x7 Court checker is a third party tool that has large collection of court cases in India containing millions of records and updated on a daily basis. Given a name and address, our smart, proprietary algorithms retrieve matching cases in a few seconds.
        
        \item \textbf{OSINT Search}: OSINT search is a feature that allows users to gather publicly available information about individuals, including personal and public details, to aid in investigations. By utilizing OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) techniques, this feature helps retrieve relevant information about the suspect, such as their personal background, social
        media activity, online presence, and other publicly accessible data. This
        comprehensive search capability assists law enforcement agencies and investigators in building a more complete profile of the culprit, aiding in the investigation process.
        
        \item \textbf{Vehicle Information:} Vehicle Information is a feature that allows users to obtain details about a specific vehicle using its registration number. By inputting the vehicle number into the system, investigators can retrieve information such as the make, model, year of manufacture, color, and ownership details of the vehicle associated with that registration number. This feature is valuable in investigations as it helps identify and
        track vehicles linked to criminal activities, providing important leads for law enforcement agencies and helping them in their pursuit of the culprits.
    \end{enumerate}
    
\end{enumerate}

\section{Call One App}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    \item \textbf{Frontend:} The frond end is design using React Native. The UI design focuses on providing an intuitive and user-friendly experience for app users. It includes screens for data collection, settings, notifications, and law enforcement functionalities.
    
    \item \textbf{Bacnkend:} Backend server is design in Express.js. various technologies are integrated in the express.js app.
    
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
        \item \textbf{Express.js} Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. APIs.
        
        \item \textbf{PostgreSQL} : PostgreSQL is used to store user details such as user contacts, call logs, devices information. PostgreSQL is an object-relational database management system (ORDMBS), which means that it has relational capabilities and an object-oriented design
        
        \item \textbf{Crypto-js}: Used AES Encryption method to encrypt user information that is transmitted over the server. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is an algorithm that uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt protected data.
