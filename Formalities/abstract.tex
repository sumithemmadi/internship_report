The aim of the Open-source Intelligence Data Mining Application is to assist law enforcement agencies, such as police departments, in crime investigations by generating a report based on call data records (CDRs) and tower dump data. The software is designed to provide a rapid and efficient report, enabling investigators to identify suspects.
The primary objective of this software is to provide various information about individuals, including vehicle details, location data, IMEI numbers, phone numbers, PAN numbers, MNP details, IP information, etc. The software generates a PDF report containing all relevant information about the person.

The software is designed to be scalable, allowing for future enhancements and additions to accommodate evolving data collection requirements. Its success is dependent on technical infrastructure, legal compliance, user adoption, interoperability, and training and support for successful implementation.
The proposed software is already in use by several law enforcement agencies, This software has some pending features under development. It is continuously updated to meet the evolving needs of law enforcement agencies and to enhance its functionality and usefulness.
